# Object Detection with YOLO

This project implements object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. YOLO is a deep learning-based approach that detects objects in images and videos by dividing them into grids and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can set up the environment using `pip` or `conda`.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolo.git
   cd object-detection-yolo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   For `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or for `conda`:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. Activate the environment (if using `conda`):

   ```bash
   conda activate yolo-env
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing results)

## Usage

To perform object detection on an image or video using a pre-trained YOLO model, use the following commands:

### For Image Input:

```bash
python detect.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

### For Video Input:

```bash
python detect.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
```

The script will output the detected objects, draw bounding boxes, and display the results on the image or video.

### Detecting Objects in Real-Time (Webcam):

```bash
python detect.py --webcam
```

This command will use your webcam to detect objects in real-time.

## Training a Custom Model

If you'd like to train YOLO on your custom dataset, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLO format (images and corresponding `.txt` annotation files).
2. Modify the configuration file to specify the number of classes and paths to your dataset.
3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data data/custom_data.yaml --cfg cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg --weights weights/yolov4.weights
   ```

The model will be trained for the specified number of epochs and save the weights after each epoch.

## Results

The model will display or save images and videos with the detected objects. Each object will be labeled with the class and confidence score.
